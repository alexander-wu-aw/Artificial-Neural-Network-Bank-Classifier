# AI-Bank-Classifier
First AI project: making a classifier that determines whether a user will stay with a bank according to their bank account information


Information about customers, including CreditScore, Age, Balance, is collected from a bank. The data is processed by appropriately managin categorical data, and applying feature scaling. The data set is split into a 80% training set and 20% test set. The network is constructed through using the keras library having 2 hidden layers with 6 neurons 

This is part of my learning process to master AI and deep learning. This is my first project applying my machine learning knowledge, and it was done with the help of an online course on Udemy.
